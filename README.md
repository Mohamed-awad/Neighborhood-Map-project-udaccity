# Neighborhood Map

I developed a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

# Install

you need to install :-

*    Install any web Browser you love like (googlechrom or firefox)

# Why this Project?

The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.
 
# Run The Application 

* download the file project.html
* right click on the file
* choose "open with"
* choose your Browser that you have installed
* press on it to open the project

# want to filter locations :-

* type the name of location in the search bar on the top of page

# That`s It Cool
